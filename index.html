                <p id="paragraph">Welcome to my website! My name is Sinan Koyuncu, and I am a passionate <b>full stack web developer.</b> With a solid foundation as a web content editor for five years, 
                    I have seamlessly transitioned into the world of programming, 
                    honing my skills and expertise through self-learning and 
                    <b>hands-on experience.</b>
                    <span id="about-span"> Throughout my journey as a web developer, I developed a deep understanding of the 
                    importance of <b>user experience and captivating content</b>. I learned how to create engaging web pages, <b>optimize 
                    content for search engines</b>, and ensure a seamless browsing experience for users. <br><br>I have strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and 
                    JavaScript. My proficiency extends to building dynamic user interfaces with <b>React and Next.js</b>, while also harnessing the power 
                    of Node.js and Express.js for robust backend development. With an eye for design, I craft responsive and visually a
                    ppealing layouts using tools like TailwindCSS and Material UI. My database expertise covers MongoDB and MySQL, 
                    leveraging MongoDB Atlas for scalable solutions. I'm well-versed in deploying applications on <b>AWS S3</b> and optimizing 
                    media with Cloudinary. Proficient in version control through <b>GIT and GitHub</b>, I ensure seamless collaboration. 

                    <br><br>One of my key strengths lies in my ability to bridge the gap between design and development. 
                    Having previously worked as a web content editor, I possess a unique perspective that enables me 
                    to understand and <b>effectively collaborate with designers, content creators, and other stakeholders</b>. 
                    I thrive in collaborative environments, and I am always eager to contribute my technical expertise while 
                    actively seeking opportunities for growth and learning.</span> <span id="about-more">SHOW MORE</span>
